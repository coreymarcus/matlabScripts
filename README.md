# matlabScripts
A bunch of general matlab scripts which have been useful in the past

BPF - Bootstrap Particle Filter
---

CKF - Cubature Kalman Filter
---

CX - Complex Step Derivative
---

e_elipse - Plots Error Ellipses
---

EKF - Extended Kalman Filter
---

frameROTM - Converts from Euler angles to a DCM
---

GQKF - Gauss-Hermite Quadrature Kalman Filter
---

GSF - Gaussian Sum Filter
---

initBPF - Initialize Bootstrap Particle Filter
---

initGSF - Initialize Gaussian Sum Filter
---

ode45orbitpropogation - A basic orbit propagator
---

OE2state - converts from orbital elements to state space
---

orbit - another simple orbit propagator
---

orbitPartials - finds the partial derivatives of an orbit
---

plot_elipse - pretty much the same as e_elipse, need to merge these two into one function
---

rbpf - Rao-Blackwellised Particle Filter
---

state2OE - Produces orbital elements from a state space
---

UKF - Unscented Kalman Filter
---

vectarrow - I didn't write this, seems redundant with matlab command quiver()
---

wahbaSolver - solves "Wahba's Problem"
---
i.e. provides a least squares estimate of a rotation given multiple vectors expressed in difference reference frames
